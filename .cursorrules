# Cursor AI Rules for This Project

## Documentation Policy
- **NEVER** create documentation files (.md, .txt, README, etc.) unless **EXPLICITLY** requested by the user
- **NEVER** proactively write guides, tutorials, or explanatory documents
- **NEVER** create summary files, migration guides, or setup instructions automatically
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks: "create documentation for X" or "write a guide for Y"
- Focus on code implementation, not documentation

## Code-First Approach
- Prioritize writing actual code over documentation
- Implement features directly without creating supporting docs
- Answer questions verbally in chat instead of creating .md files
- If clarification is needed, ask in the response, don't document assumptions

## When Documentation IS Allowed
- User explicitly says "create a README" or "write documentation"
- User asks "document this API" or "create a guide for X"
- User requests setup instructions specifically
- Inline code comments are always acceptable

## Default Behavior
- Write code
- Fix bugs
- Implement features
- Explain things in chat responses
- **DO NOT** create .md files

## Examples

❌ WRONG:
- Creating MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md after making changes
- Writing API_GUIDE.md when implementing endpoints
- Generating SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for new features
- Creating AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md when adding auth

✅ CORRECT:
- Just implement the feature
- Explain in chat if needed
- Only create .md files when user explicitly asks

## Remember
Code speaks louder than documentation. The user can read the code.
